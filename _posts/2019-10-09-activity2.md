## Use the following code snippets to alter the PISA notebook.

If you make a mistake, you check the [source file](https://github.com/research-reuse/PISA/tree/master/pisa_basic/notebooks) to copy and paste the original code. You can also try pressing `File > Revert to Checkpoint` in the Jupyter notebook top menu.

## 1. Turn on line numbers.

## 2. Run all of the cells.

## 3. Got to cell 6. Follow the instructions on lines 14, 37, and 51 below.

## 4. Re-run cell 6 by clicking in the cell and pressing `shift` + `return`. If there are any errors, check your code for typos and try again.

From here on, the cell numbers in the Jupyter notebook will change depending on how many times you run the code within that cell.

## 5. Insert a new cell for each of the additional years you've added.

## 6. Type the additonal variable names into the new cells and press `shift` + `return` to run each one.

For example:  
`all_pisa_2012.head()`  
`all_pisa_2009.head()`

If there are errors, check for typos and try again.

## 7. There's an error in the tenth cell and I don't know how to fix it. Read the error message to determine which line is the problem.

Seriously though. The error has something to do with '[numpy](https://numpy.org)' and 'floats'. I don't know enough about numpy to fix it.

## 8. See how many other cells you can get to work! Both with the existing variables, and the new variables you've created.
